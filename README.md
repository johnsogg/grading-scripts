grading-scripts
===============

This is a collection of grading scripts. They grade homework
assignments for the University of Colorado's CSCI 1300 and CSCI 2270
classes.

_These files are publicly viewable for a two main reasons_: first,
they may contain bugs that other people (students!) might spot (and,
if you're the first to report a particular bug, there's extra credit
in it for you). Second, unit testing is an important aspect of
software development, and this gives you some exposure to how that
works.

_These files are NOT publicly viewable so you can execute them
directly._ It won't work out of the box. You'll need:

- The RetroGrade grading scripts (which are private to teaching staff
  for these courses)
  
- To get JUnit and the Google Test Framework and install them

Don't email me about how to get this to work. (Sorry, I get more email
than my eyeballs can read.)

If you have particular questions about a unit test (maybe you found a
bug?) then it's OK to mail me about it.
